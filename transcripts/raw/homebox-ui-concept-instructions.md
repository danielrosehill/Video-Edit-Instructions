Okay, the purpose of this screen cast is to um, prove a concept for a workflow in which I provide instructions to AI via screen cast, much as if I were sending a Loom to a colleague. And recording this um, in the idea that it might work today, it might not work today with multimodal video to uh a video pipeline, it might work in a few months, but this is just an example. Um, and this is a real project. This is a fork of Homebox an inventory system and I think we just have the last few sort of loose ends I would say with UI that I'm uh prompting Claude code to fix up. And uh

I don't want to actually I'm I'm watching Claude code as I record this working on the view edit function, so I don't want to include that in this instructions as it should hopefully be implemented correctly. So rather I'll focus on additional instructions, other other things that are wrong. Um, okay, so this is an item, this is the item view, which is the most important part of the app.

And I'm just gonna do a quick spot check. We have the room display, correct. Location updater should pull the rooms, success. 

Assign to location. Success.

Spec generation. So let's let's just test this. This is the IKEA Sniglar. And it's the what did my wife just tell me?

120 by 60 cm variant, so I'm going to try put that information in somewhere. And this is I would say the first friction point. Where would I record this information? So now that we separated the notes tab,

I think we should um, we have specs, but they can't be edited in the front end here on the overview page. So that's the first thing, first thing to fix is the specs here should be editable. And this isn't really a spec. Um, I guess I'll put it here in model number. What do we say? 120 by 60 centimeters. Okay.

Now we're going to click on Save Changes and verify it success. Model number. I think let's add one more field to the database called um variant because I think the model number should be kept for the exact MN if it exists. So in this what I would probably rather have done here is is populated 120 by 60 as the variant, and that should be a uh varchar field 255 character limit. So short text basically. Um, but now IKEA Sniglar and the disniglar from this I should be able to get the spec. So I'm going to click on Generate specs and this is going to be sending the call to Gemini. And the idea here is that Gemini slash latest is the API model, and it's going to be sent IKEA Sniglar 120 by 60 and it should return now we still have this bug. Failed to Save specs. So, um, I'll share the debugging outlet, but that indicates that that bug remains in the app. Um, so we have a a bug to fix there, cuz that feature would be extremely helpful. Um,

There is many things, but I'll just refocus on the main ones and maybe I I guess I can do a composite here. So I noted that this was product dimensions. I wanted to label the photos I attached the inventory. And what I think would be great is if in the gallery view here, we had little um, an overview. So this would have a little um pill icon saying dimensions so that you can quickly click up to it.

And I think these buttons, Browse Gallery and Camera, are basically intended for um for the phone, for use on a mobile. So what I think would actually make more sense, I'm thinking of ways just to consolidate this UI, is that the drag and drop functionality for dragging a new photo, that logically belongs with photos. Um, and I think the best way to implement this would be we have the photo gallery here, and we have after the last photograph a little drop zone there, even if it's vertical, saying drag and drop. And that would mean that we can take it out of this and this can just be a much more, you know, condensed, it can be a quarter column um, that we can even maybe have just shown mobile. In fact, I'm going to correct myself. I want to be able to upload drag and drop and also from the from the file system. So let's do this. Let's put this upload elements the card beneath the photos card, and we'll have buttons for browse, camera, upload, drag and drop so that that works on uh mobile and works on desktop. And that means we can have the product information front and center up the top left. Um, okay, Media card. We should have a consistent functionality with photos there. So that means we have the pill displays as I mentioned for the uh photo type and a four-part uploads card beneath it. Ideally, the non the mobile elements would be would only show on a mobile breakpoint. So browse and camera. And on a desktop breakpoint we have the other ones. Now I added camera, actually, it's supposed to work through a webcam, or should have webcam support. If I just uh make sure I'm not on camera, I'm uh I'm half in my state of semi-undress. That's working, which is really cool. So, um that's a positive there. I'm just going to exit out of this. Do a refresh in fact. Okay, so the webcam direct uh feature from from desktop has been validated, accidentally, so that's positive. Specs. Um, Now, if I go into the edit version, at least the temporarily the the one that is uh is in the old UI or well, it shortly be the old UI. Um, spec one, not bad. It would be nicer to have a markdown editor that renders directly into readable, but for the moment let's just note that as a down the line fix. It's it's okay for the moment. That's fine. And I should if I'm just going to save this now, I should be able to rep reproduce the spec. I'm just checking actually if I can reproduce the AI spec generation error or bug. Um, and we have a condition here in which I have written a human generated spec, even though it's just a placeholder. And the logic I think is that the AI at the moment is prevented from overriding a human spec. I think probably the best one is actually a logic whereby if there is a human spec, the AI can add it after a blank line. So I can kind of start a scrappy spec, AI can give me a better one and then I can just kind of manually edit the two together. I think that would be better than just a blanket protection rule. But that's a very useful functionality that clearly is not working. Um, now regarding the item type um, things, we have these networking and electrical parameters that are not not currently um, if I go into this thing here, the crib, I go to edit and I want to make it an overview. Uh, I want to assign it as I guess the type would be furniture. Um, again, this is stuff that's really not obvious in the UI at all, notes, related, purchase warranty, overview. Yeah, there's nowhere to uh the type thing, the type selector, if I create a new item, I can select the asset type and it's working. Good. But I can't update it in any way. So that's a problem too. So I would say the most logical part for this is um, Let me just close the door so we don't get that background noise. The most logical place for the type uh updating is I think in in the top bar here. Update location put in box, um, then we can have one called type or update type. If there's no type, it's generic, it should still show and we can just assign a type. If there is a type, this can be used to update the type. The types are mutually exclusive, so it's a it's a single selection. Um, and then I'm trying to keep this tight. Uh, Generate specs, we can just remove that from the top for the moment actually, I would say. And suggest storage can be nested under other actions and giveaway posts can be nested under other actions. So we in the updated top bar here where I'm kind of circling my mouse around, update, put in box, change type or update type. And then the other ones can be nested under other actions. Um, next tab, the notes tab, let me just test a note. I add a note delightful. Now what's missing in the front end is the ability to edit the note. I can delete the note. Let's just check if I can delete the note. No, there should be a safety check here, a confirmation model. Are you sure you want to delete? Toast. Um, and I should have the ability to edit a previous note with a little editing icon and update. So we're missing a couple of things there. Related items. Okay, this is potentially very useful for keeping plugs and adaptors and things together. There's nothing related to this, but let's just say for argument sake, I want to associate it with a torch. Now, I've got torch, torch, torch for car. Um, I need in the related items dropdown a little bit more information to know which one I'm uh referring to. And I think what would be good would be to have a card display with the item thumbnail and the storage location. So it could come up as like torch, maybe manufacturer is would be good to show here, asset ID and location. So just a card for the uh the selection, but I'm just going to go for a random one without knowing which torch I'm referring to. And let's see what kind of a UI we've ended up with. Um, okay, I can click out to it. This is one of my old ones. Not very not not a very useful uh not a very useful torch. I'll probably throw it out. So that's, okay, so the basics are kind of there. We can delete it, remove the relation to torch. So those messages like will be should be more user more user facing. So just remove dissocation or something. Um, or related torch created relationship. Something less technical. And in the in that dropdown, the search the search dropdown for searching for related items, and in the display card here when you do one when you add one, it should show the thumbnail, the name, the asset ID, storage location box, so I can quickly see the ideas if I see this as a uh this is a rotor. This is the specific ACDC adaptor, click into it. Purchase and warranty information. Okay, so this is actually uh potentially useful information. And if I go into the edit uh tab here, I'm not able to edit the purchase info, as you can see. So when I was in details, if I click into view, I can see the purchase info. But that doesn't show up in edit. And eventually I want to make sure I want to be able to select the currency as well as the purchase price, but that's a down-the-line feature. Um, and warranty here it makes sense we have defined in media a value for warranty. So on purchase and warranty, these these fields. For purchase, we have a purchase receipt. So in the purchase and warranty tab, we should have if there's an invoice or a receipt, it should show under purchase. If there's a warranty, it should show under warranty. And when we're in the edit view, we should have the ability to add those associations. Um, such that the media tab can be the media tab allows you to do all these things, but the logical flow in the UI would be that you'd want to um be able to create and view them from this tab as well. And then for I would let's also change the UI label from purchase and warranty to just uh purchase and let's move it to the left of related. And let's move the notes to the far right. So the the ultimate tab order would be overview. And I'm also going to note some other change. Overview specs, media, purchase, related notes. That from left to right.
